# Level 1 Crook Calculator

If you came here, maybe you are not a Level 100 Mafia Boss, but it doesn't matter, because:

> A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

Now go count your weapons or how many times you shot the bank.

## Usage

Build and run (cargo, rustc, whatever), even a crook knows how to do this. Then enter you precious numbers like this:

```
3 * ( ( 2 + 1 - 1 ) ^ 2 ) / 2 - 3.5
```

**Remember about spaces.** Why is that a thing? Because you can do this:

```
1 + -1
```

When you enter something invalid, you have to go again and enter something valid.

Good luck.
